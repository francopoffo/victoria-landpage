# About

This is my first professional project. A landing page for a lawyer in Brazil. The main goal was to have the best performance and SEO.

The project was made using several features from Next.js:

- file-base routing
- static props generation
- performance features like next/image, next/script, next/font
- SEO performance with Head component and \_document.js

Other technologies used:

- Lighthouse and Vercel to measure performance and SEO.
- CSS modules and React Icons (only for the contact page) for styling
- Firebase for storing data
- Google tag added to sync the page with Google Ads
- Custom hook: useWindowSize
- Form backend platform by [formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/)

## How to run it

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
