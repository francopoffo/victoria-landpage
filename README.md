# About

This is my first professional project. A landing page for a lawyer in Brazil.

The project was made using several features from Next.js:

- file-base routing
- static props generation
- performance features like next/image and next/script
- SEO performance with Head component and \_document.js

Other:

- CSS modules and React Icons for styling
- Firebase for storing data
- Google tag added to sync the page with Google Ads


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Colors I used to style my components

```css
--off-white: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
--light-bege: #f7f3ee;
--mid-bege: #e5dbd0;
--bege: #beb4a8;
--dark-grey: #333;
```
